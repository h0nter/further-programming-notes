# Lecture 8 - Design Patterns and GUIs

### Design Patterns - **IN THE EXAM!!!**
- Reusable patterns for solving problems
- Not a solution - an approach
- Not just for one problem domain
- Not just for Java (or any technology)
- Not describing a single class, but patterns of relationships and interactions
- Best practice to common situations, with well understood implications

### Design Pattern 1: Model-View-Controller (MVC)
**MVC** - separates the application desgin into 3 separate modules, of which any one can be re-built/re-designed without affecting the others.

- **Model**: data and methods for manipulating it
- **View**: the visual representation of the data
- **Controller**: handling of user controls (inc. arranging the view into a user interface)
